# Subwaze. Waze for Subways

* The idea
  Originally, the focus of this group was to solve the lackluster result queries when searching for an apartment; however, we realize that the underlying problem we could focus on was subway systems, how they work, how data is updated, and user input to fill in the gaps. At this point, we discovered the same as Waze as the most real-time data you could get would be from three sources:  
        * MTA's Real Time Travel Analysis  
        * Real Time User Logs  
        * Previous Statistical User experience (By Time, Location, Events)  
        
  Using these idea's we decided to use this information to create a base foundation where users would input the current and future location, look at the time scheduling regarding their trip, and then give feedback regarding their train arrival time, spacing in the train, and any potential delay. We believe this will be an efficient want to ensure customers will have a better experience using public transport, now, and in the future.
